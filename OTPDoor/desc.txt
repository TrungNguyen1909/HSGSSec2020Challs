# OTP Door

I've heard of a super secure OTP-protected door that seals a great secret. I don't have access to the OTP generator, and I've been trying inputting some numbers multiple times but I've failed to unlock it.

I've heard of some witches discussing how ridiculous the secure system was. Some of them have even break into the door effortlessly with their witchcraft. I don't know witchcraft, but I was able to get a copy of the door's firmware. I heard that you have been practicing witchcraft recently, so maybe you could break into the door and find the secret?
